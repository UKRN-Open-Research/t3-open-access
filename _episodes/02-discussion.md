> - What challenges have you faced in publishing OA (or anticipate your attendees would face)?
> - What do you (the trainer) not know about open access that you want to learn before you give a workshop?
> - Which aspects of the workshop template would you use in your workshop? What is missing? What would you leave out or change?
> - Who is your intended audience? Take the workshop attendees’ perspective – what do they want out of this workshop? How to target /recruit them to attend?
